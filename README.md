Performance Testing(Booking) :
Welcome! This GitHub repository houses comprehensive performance testing documentation for restful-booker.herokuapp.com. It encompasses a variety of APIs employing different HTTP methods. Within this repository, we employ JMeter to execute performance tests aimed at ascertaining the API collection's ability to gracefully handle a high volume of concurrent threads (users) without encountering errors.
Load Testing:
This process assesses the application's performance under expected user loads. The goal is to uncover any performance bottlenecks before the software application is launched.
Collection of API:
This set of APIs for restful-booker.herokuapp.com encompasses various HTTP methods, including POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT, which are utilized for testing purposes. Test data is both established and manipulated within this set of APIs, as data is initially set, subsequently called, updated using a token, and finally deleted using a token, all as part of this comprehensive test coverage.
